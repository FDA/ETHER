Woke up with a really bad sore throat at 06:00. Also had fever/chills and arthralgias. 24 hours in quarters with Motrin and Tylenol. Dx'd with viral syndrome. Later that night, started feeling chest pain radiating to neck. Went back to ER and was admitted on 2/19/03. Treated with GI Cocktail with no results. Treated with 3 nitroglycerin tablets and with IV Morphine. Discharged on 2/24/03. Convalescent leave for 7 days and take Motrin and Aspirin. Viral myocarditis can also be caused by enteroviruses and adenoviruses to name a few; however, if he has myocarditis, it is almost certainly related to Smallpox vaccination given the temporal relation. We also considered coronary vasospasm, especially given the cardiologist's subjective assessment of decreased myocardial perfusion on the catheterization which can be associated with coronary vasospasm. However, it is my understanding that vasospasm causing this degree of damage in the absence of concomitant CAD is a very, very rare occurrence. Furthermore, the pt never had any other symptoms consistent with angina and I would have expected nitroglycerin to give him prompt relief in the setting of vasospasm. Therefore, given the concomitant viral symptoms due to Smallpox vaccination and the normal catheterization results, I feel this pt most likely has acute viral myocarditis presumedly due to vaccinia. Yet, myocarditis is a clinical dx and there is no way to definitively test this hypothesis (except by myocardial biopsy). We will be re-evaluating this pt today and tomorrow in our ICU to get more info, however, I doubt my assessment will change."
